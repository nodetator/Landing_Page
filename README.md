Last CSS Exercise of TheOdinProject Foundations part.

Logging my status of learning as a web developer:
- Really struggling in CSS, how is it possible to design complex websites when I can't use flexbox that well?
- HTML is okay, for now, the basics are relatively easy (as designed by theOdinProject)
- Web Development really demands a pretty high bar for design, I guess the same could be said for front-end development?
