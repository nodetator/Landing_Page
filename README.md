# Landing_Page
Last CSS Exercise of TheOdinProject Foundations part.

Logging my status of learning as a web developer:
- Really struggling in CSS, how is it possible to design complex websites when I can't use flexbox that well?
- HTML is okay, for now, the basics are relatively easy (as designed by theOdinProject)
- Web Development really demands a pretty high bar for design.

In searching for material to try and improve the learning process, I found certain principles that are relevant:

(1) Propositional Learning

    Studying from books, blogs, youtube, and podcasts.

(2) Performative Learning

    Actual doing. In web dev and programming it means the actual act of writing code.

(3) Emotional Learning

    Dealing with your emotions. Learning new things involves frustration, procrastination, anger, stress etc. How you manage these will be criticaly to your success.

I will be expanding on these principles in a full blog post at nodetator.xyz. For now, lets continue with the Landing Page!
